# Overview
_[LipSurf](https://www.lipsurf.com) plugins are like [UserScripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) (eg. GreaseMonkey et al.) for voice._

Firstly, _**prohst**_ to you! By nature of being on this page, I can tell you have exquisite taste for software!

### What are you talking about?

[LipSurf](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lipsurf/lnnmjmalakahagblkkcnjkoaihlfglon) is a Google Chrome Extension that enables users to browse with their voice, augmenting the mouse/keyboard paradigm enabling hands-free productivity. This serves many purposes:

 - Using the computer while your hands are dirty or busy (eating, cleaning etc.)
 - For those with physical impairments or those wishing to prevent repetitive stress injury of the hands
 - Quick shortcuts for complex motions (eg. <span class="voice-cmd">compose mail to John</span> can open up a prefilled email message on gmail faster than traditional navigation)
 - Being far from the computer keyboard/mouse (eg. media center PCs)

Writing your own plugins for LipSurf is *pleasureably* straightforward.
