### What are you talking about?

[LipSurf](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lipsurf/lnnmjmalakahagblkkcnjkoaihlfglon) is a Google Chrome Extension that enables users to browse with their voice, augmenting the mouse/keyboard paradigm enabling hands-free productivity. This serves many purposes:

 - Eating in front of your computer or otherwise controlling the computer with dirty hands off the keyboard
 - For those with physical impairments or those wishing to prevent repetitive stress injury of the hands
 - Quick shortcuts for complex motions (eg. <span class="voice-cmd">compose mail to John</span> can open up a prefilled email message on gmail faster than traditional navigation)
 - Being far from the computer controls (eg. media center PCs)
