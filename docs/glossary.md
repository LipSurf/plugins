# Glossary

### activated
When the extension button is pressed, and a circular red recording symbol shows in the LipSurf extension icon, LipSurf is actively accepting commands and is "activated".

### command
A command performs an action based on a certain voice input. Every command is a part of a plugin.

### live text
The text that shows on the top of the page when you speak and LipSurf is activated. Can be configured in the options.

### match property
The utterance that activates a given command is specified via match properties. Match properties can be simple strings, strings with special characters to represent wildcard or numeral text, or with full-on functions!

### no headphones mode
Will be changed to "headphones mode" soon. When you don't use headphones, audio from the speakers can feed back into the microphone which is usually undesirable when you're watching a video. With "no headphones mode" on the live text does not show when media is detected to be playing on the page â€” unless there's a valid command.

### plugin
All the commands in LipSurf are grouped into families called _plugins_. LipSurf plugins can be created by anyone. They extend the default functionality of LipSurf to make it infinitely extensible.

### pro
"pro" is the payed version of LipSurf that has even more powerful features and premium support. You can subscribe to pro [via the site](https://www.lipsurf.com/pricing).
