# Unit Testing

[`Commands`](/api-reference/command.md#command) may define a `test` function.

In the future, the tests will likely be run automatically to make sure plugins stay working for the pages that they run on.

Tests have a special context that they run in. Using `this` in a test allows us to access the test-specific API functionality.
